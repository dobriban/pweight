#P-value Weighting R Package

This R package contains open source implementations of several p-value weighting methods, including Spjotvoll, exponential and Bayes weights.  These are methods for improving power in multiple testing via the use of prior information. 

Several of these methods were were developed by the authors in the following papers:
*Optimal Multiple Testing Under a Gaussian Prior on the Effect Sizes* by Dobriban, Fortney, Kim, Owen:  http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02935

Please see the vignette or the help files for examples and a description of the methods.

Please contact the authors if you have any questions.
