#' pweight: P-value weighting in multiple testing.
#'
#' The pweight package provides functions to compute various p-value
#' weighting schemes, as Spjotvoll, exponential and Bayes weights. These are methods for improving power in multiple testing via the use of prior informaton.
#'
#'
#' Several of these methods were proposed by the authors in the following papers:
#' "Optimal Multiple Testing Under a
#'  Gaussian Prior on the Effect Sizes", by Dobriban, Fortney, Kim and Owen,
#'   \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02935}
