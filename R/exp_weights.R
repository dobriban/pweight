#' Exponential p-value weights
#'
#' Computes the exponential p-value weights for multiple testing.
#' Given estimated means \code{mu} of test statistics \code{T},
#' the p-value weights are proportional to \code{exp(-beta*mu)},
#' for a tilt parameter \code{beta}. In addition, the large weights are truncated
#' at a maximum value \code{UB} (upper bound), and the remaining weight is re-distributed
#' among the rest of the statistics.
#'
#' Specifically, it is assumed that \code{T} are Gaussian with mean
#' \code{mu}. One-sided tests of \code{mu>=0} against \code{mu<0}
#'  are conducted using the test statistics \code{T}. To optimize power,
#'  different levels are allocated to different tests.

#'  For more details, see the paper "Optimal Multiple Testing Under a
#'  Gaussian Prior on the Effect Sizes", by Dobriban, Fortney, Kim and Owen,
#'   \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02935}
